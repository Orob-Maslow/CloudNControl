# Grbl

Grbl is an extremely common firmware/protocol option for CNC machines.

Many manufacturers simply ship their CNC machines with Grbl, as it is such a well-known open-source (free) piece of Arduino code. If you're not sure what controller your CNC machine uses, chances are pretty good it uses Grbl.
