# Machines

Makerverse uses various [controllers](/features/#controllers) to speak to different machines.

## Supported Machines

_**Note**: when [creating a workspace](/tutorial/create-workspace/), some machines come pre-configured via the community catalog._

If you _cannot find your machine_ (in the app or in this documentation), it is nevertheless _likely to still be supported_ (as long as it uses a standard protocol). You will need to identify the correct **controller** for the protocol, as well as the baud rate (which is probably buried somewhere in your machine's documentation).

## Firmware

Firmware is the code which runs on the machine itself (usually, an Arduino board connected via USB). Your machine likely came pre-installed with some firmware.

Generally, you should be certain you are using the latest firmware for your machine. If you have selected a machine from the community catalog, you will receive recommendations and support links for your firmware.

## Machine-Specific Instructions

In some cases, like with the Maslow CNC, there are also important machine-specific instructions to follow. Please be sure to read any instructions related to your machine in this documentation or in the app.
