## Turn Off Login (Guest Mode)

 In [extreme cases](/features/security/#security-hazards) this may result in a **risk to your physical safety**!!

_Edit the `~/.makerverse` to include the top-level `insecureDangerousGuestAccess` boolean key._

In keeping with Makerverse's "easier to be secure" philosophy, guests are required to bypass the login screen at regular intervals (whereas logged-in users stay logged in).
