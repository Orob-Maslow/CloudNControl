# Security

Makerverse protects access to your machine(s) with an account/log-in system.

## Account Creation

When you create (or log in) to your account, it prevents your Makerverse installation from being accessed by malicious parties. The Makerverse account system is powered by OpenWorkShop.

## Offline Usage

When you first install Makerverse and log in to your account, an internet connection is required. After that point, Makerverse will continue to work even if there is no internet available.

## Password Recovery

If at any point you become locked out of your account, you can reset your password using the email address you used to create the account.
