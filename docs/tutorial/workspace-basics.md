# Workspace Basics

First, **open** the **connection** to your machine (via the top-left widget).

## Console

Below the connection widget is the **console**.

This shows the direct output from the machine as it runs. You can also use it to issue commands directly to the machine.

_**Tip**: watch the console! You can learn a lot from observing the commands issued to your machine._

## Machine

Below the console, you will find your machine-specific settings, configurations, calibration, etc. (which will vary based upon the type of machine you have connected).

## Visualizer

The center of the screen shows the **visualizer**.

At the top, it will inform you of errors or alerts. In the main area, it will show any loaded programs. You can zoom, pan, and tilt in all three dimensions to observe your machine.

## Controls

In the upper-right, you can find the **controls** widget.

Use the **yellow & blue arrow buttons** to manually move the machine.

_**Tip**: if the movement buttons are grayed out, your machine may need to be unlocked._

As the machine moves, observe:

* **Machine Position**: the absolute, "real" location of the machine.
* **Work Position**: the relative location, used when [running a program](/tutorial/run-programs).

_**Tip**: if your machine position is wrong, it may need to be calibrated or homed._

Use the "pin" icons underneath any of the values to set the current position as zero.

## Other Widgets

- **G-code**: shows the status of any currently uploaded program.
- **Probe**: runs a "probe" command to zero an axis (if your machine supports it).
- **Spindle**: controls cutter speed, coolant, etc. (if your machine supports it).
- **Laser**: controls laser power, etc. (if your machine supports it).
- **Webcam**: connects to a camera attached to the Makerverse computer for monitoring.
