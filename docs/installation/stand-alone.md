# Stand-Alone Application

In the [Latest Release](https://github.com/makermadecnc/makerverse/releases/latest/), find the appropriate file, beginning with `makerverse-app-` and ending with...

- **Windows**: `.exe`
- **MacOS**: `.pkg`
- **Linux**: _various_

After installing, these applications run a UI (app), which is really a dedicated web browser (called Electron). Connect your machine directly to the computer via the USB port, and you're ready to go.

When installing on Windows & MacOS, you will need to bypass/accept the security systems because the app is not yet "signed." Basically this means we're working on making it AppStore compatible.
