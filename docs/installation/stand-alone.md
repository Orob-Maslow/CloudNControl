# Stand-Alone Application

## Downloading

In the [Latest Release](https://github.com/makermadecnc/makerverse/releases/latest/), find the appropriate file, beginning with `makerverse-app-` and ending with...

- **Windows**: `.exe`
- **MacOS**: `.pkg`
- **Linux**: _various_

## Installation

When installing on Windows & MacOS, you will need to bypass/accept the security systems because the app is not yet "signed." Basically this means we're working on making it AppStore compatible.

- MacOS: [opening a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
- Windows 10: [allow apps from anywhere](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4458596/windows-10-change-your-app-recommendation-settings).

## First-Run

These applications run a UI (app), which is really a dedicated web browser (called Electron). Connect your machine directly to the computer via the USB port, and you're ready to go.

## Updating

To update the stand-alone application, you must download and install the latest release.
