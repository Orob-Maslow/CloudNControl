# Web Server

With this approach, you can connect to the Makerverse app from any web browser on the same network. This should work on any computer, but it is best suited for a Linux computer which can act as a dedicated web server.

## Launch Script

There is a launch script located in this repository at `bin/launch`. Just run it from a command prompt on almost any machine. The Launch Script is going to try to run Makerverse via Docker (by default). See the [Docker Quickstart](/installation/web-server/docker/) section for help.
