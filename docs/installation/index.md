You can always find the latest versions on the [Releases page](https://github.com/makermadecnc/makerverse/releases/).

There are **two primary ways** to run Makerverse.

- **Stand-Alone**: easy to install on Mac and Windows, but can only be used from that computer.
- **Web Server**: works on any computer; can be accessed from any web browser.
