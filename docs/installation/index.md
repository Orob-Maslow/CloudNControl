# Installation

You can always find the latest versions on the [Releases page](https://github.com/makermadecnc/makerverse/releases/).

## Methods

There are **two primary ways** to run Makerverse.

- **Stand-Alone**: easy to install on Mac and Windows; harder to update.
- **Web Server**: works on any computer; has automatic updates.

## Recommendations

1. If you have a Raspberry Pi, just [flash the pre-built image](/installation/web-server/raspberry-pi/) for the easiest, most full-featured solution.
2. If you're **non-technical** and **only** using Makerverse on a **Mac/Windows** computer, use the [stand-alone install](/installation/stand-alone/).
3. Otherwise, use the [generic web server install](/installation/web-server/) (works with just about any computer).

## Prereleases (Beta Versions)

Prereleases (a.k.a. "Beta" versions) are also available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/makermadecnc/makerverse/releases/).

Make sure to turn on the "Preleases" in Settings -> General after installing the application.
